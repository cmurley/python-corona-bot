# Python COVID-19 Bot
Python Bot to Scrape CDC and Texas DPHS for Coronavirus Updates.
The goal of this project was to use Beautiful Soup in python to scrape two different websites for COVID-19 numbers and send the info to a slack channel.

I built this back in 2020 when everyone first went into lockdown. These sites have probably changed since then. This script will probably no longer work but the concept is there and can be adapted into other projects.
